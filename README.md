## What is LangChain?
LangChain is an open-source framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It provides:
- The concept of **chains** to connect multiple steps in an LLM workflow
- **Model-agnostic development**, allowing you to switch between different LLMs without changing core logic
- A **complete ecosystem** with a variety of reusable components
- Built-in support for **memory and state management**
